Hi [Name],

I noticed the link to [old tool] on your [article title] is broken. 

I've built TopTube World Pro (link), which provides similar YouTube 
channel rankings with data for 197 countries. Would you consider 
updating the link?

Best,
[Your name]
```

### B. Resource Page Outreach
Target pages titled:

**How to Find**:
```
Google searches:

```
